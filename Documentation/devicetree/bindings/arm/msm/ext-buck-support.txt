* MSM EXT BUCK SUPPORT

EXT BUCK SUPPORT driver is for supporting the external buck controlled by RPM.
This driver sends active and sleep set votes when handshaking with rpm for
supporting external buck by toggling a gpio to trun-on and turn-off external
buck.

The required properties for EXT BUCK SUPPORT are:

- compatible: "qcom,ext-buck-support"

The optional properties are:
- qcom,gpio-num: Indicates the GPIO number which will turn-on and turn-off
		 the external buck.
- qcom,settling-time: Indicates the settling time for the external buck to
		      get turn-on or turn-off. Settling time is calculated
		      in terms of QTIMER(19.2MHz).

Example:
	qcom,ext-buck-support {
		compatible = "qcom,ext-buck-support";
		qcom,gpio-num = <50>;
		qcom,settling-time = <2580>;
	};
